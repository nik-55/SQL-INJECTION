# Terms Related To Cybersecurity

Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.

## Brute-force

- This is a method for guessing a password (or the key used to encrypt a message) that involves systematically trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found.
- Although this only works if someone has used an everyday word as a password – rather than using a combination of letters, numbers and non-alpha-numeric characters.
- `One way to reduce the susceptibility to a brute-force attack is to limit the number of permitted attempts to enter a password.`

### Dictionary Attack

- Attack uses a list of possible password templates and automatically generates a variable component. For example, based on information about the victim’s name, an attacker can test the password denisXYZ, substituting XYZ for the numbers 001 to 999.

> Use Strong Passwords

## Rootkit

- A rootkit is a type of malware designed to give hackers access to and control over a target device.

### Hackers install rootkits on target machines in a number of ways:

- The most common is through phishing or another type of social engineering attack.
- Victims unknowingly download and install malware that hides within other processes running on their machines and give the hackers control of almost all aspects of the operating system.

> Download Trusted Software only.

## Distributed Network Attacks

- Often referred to as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- Network resources – such as web servers – have a finite limit to the number of requests that they can service simultaneously.
- The DDoS attack will send multiple requests to the attacked web resource – with the aim of exceeding the website’s capacity to handle multiple requests and prevent the website from functioning correctly.

## Social Engineering

- Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.

### Phishing

- This is a type of cybersecurity attack during which malicious actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.
- Phishing messages manipulate a user, causing them to perform actions like installing a malicious file, clicking a malicious link, or divulging sensitive information such as access credentials.

> Don’t open emails , links and attachments from suspicious sources

> Don’t insert unknown removable like disc or pen drives into a computer.

## Firewall

- It is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies.
- It is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

---

## Intercepting the Public Wifi

- When you connect to public wi-fi and free public hotspots, there are severe risks of data breaches.
- The main reason for it is unencrypted data. While being connected to a free service, the data from your device goes unencrypted to the router.
- It means that anyone using the same network can look at your traffic and thereby steal your data.

### Eavesdropping Attack

- It occurs when a hacker intercepts, deletes, or modifies data that is transmitted between two devices.

> Avoid using unsecured public WIFI networks.

---

## Malware

- It is a file or code, typically delivered over a network, that infects, explores, steals or conducts virtually any behavior an attacker wants.
- Email attachments containing malicious code can be forwarded unknowningly by an user and thus the malware can spread even deeper into an organization, further compromising a network.

### Ransomware

- It is a type of malware that threatens to publish or blocks access to data or a computer system, usually by encrypting it, until the victim pays a ransom fee to the attacker.
- In many cases, the ransom demand comes with a deadline. If the victim doesn’t pay in time, the data is gone forever.

---

## Botnet

- It is a network of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single attacking party, known as the “bot-herder.”
- Each individual machine under the control of the bot-herder is known as a bot.
- From one central point, the attacking party can command every computer on its botnet to simultaneously carry out a coordinated criminal action.
- The scale of a botnet (many comprised of millions of bots) enable the attacker to perform large-scale actions.

---

## Encryption

- It is the conversion of data from a readable format into an encoded format. Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it's been decrypted.
- It is the simplest and most important way to ensure a computer system's information can't be stolen and read by someone who wants to use it for malicious purposes.

---

## OSI Model

- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.

### 7 layers of OSI Model

- Application Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer
