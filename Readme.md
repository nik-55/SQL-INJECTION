# Terms Related To Cybersecurity

Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.

## Brute-force

- This is a method for guessing a password (or the key used to encrypt a message) that involves systematically trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found.
- Although this only works if someone has used an everyday word as a password – rather than using a combination of letters, numbers and non-alpha-numeric characters.
- `One way to reduce the susceptibility to a brute-force attack is to limit the number of permitted attempts to enter a password.`

### Dictionary Attack

- Attack uses a list of possible password templates and automatically generates a variable component. For example, based on information about the victim’s name, an attacker can test the password denisXXX, substituting XXX for the numbers 001 to 999.

> Use Strong Passwords

## Rootkit

- A rootkit is a type of malware designed to give hackers access to and control over a target device.

### Hackers install rootkits on target machines in a number of ways:

- The most common is through phishing or another type of social engineering attack.
- Victims unknowingly download and install malware that hides within other processes running on their machines and give the hackers control of almost all aspects of the operating system.

> Download Trusted Software only.

## Distributed Network Attacks

- Often referred to as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- Network resources – such as web servers – have a finite limit to the number of requests that they can service simultaneously.
- The DDoS attack will send multiple requests to the attacked web resource – with the aim of exceeding the website’s capacity to handle multiple requests and prevent the website from functioning correctly.

## Social Engineering

- Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.

### Phishing

- This is a type of cybersecurity attack during which malicious actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.
- Phishing messages manipulate a user, causing them to perform actions like installing a malicious file, clicking a malicious link, or divulging sensitive information such as access credentials.

> Don’t open emails , links and attachments from suspicious sources

> Don’t insert unknown removable like disc or pen drives into a computer.

## Firewall

- It is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies.
- It is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

---

## Intercepting the Public Wifi

- When you connect to public wi-fi and free public hotspots, there are severe risks of data breaches.
- The main reason for it is unencrypted data. While being connected to a free service, the data from your device goes unencrypted to the router.
- It means that anyone using the same network can look at your traffic and thereby steal your data.
